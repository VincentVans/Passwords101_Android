# Passwords 101 Android
Generate a strong, unique password for every occasion! Ad-free and offline!

This app generates a strong password based on a master password and an input, usually a url. This means you'll have a strong, unique, generated password for every occasion, yet only need to remember one password. The master password still needs to be a strong password, but that is your own responsibility.

The master password is never stored, but the urls (or other input) are stored locally, so that you don't need to remember if that password contained special characters or was limited to a specific length.

Privacy policy:
No data leaves your phone, and your passwords are never stored, so everything remains private
