# Passwords 101 Android
Generate a strong, unique password for every occasion! Ad-free and offline!

This app generates a strong password based on a master password and an input, usually a url. This means you'll have a strong, unique, generated password for every occasion, yet only need to remember one password. The master password still needs to be a strong password, but that is your own responsibility.

The master password is never stored, but the urls (or other input) are stored locally, so that you don't need to remember if that password contained special characters or was limited to a specific length.

tldr: No data leaves your phone, and your passwords are never stored, so everything remains private.

## Introduction

Welcome to Passwords 101! We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the absence of data collection when you use our password generation application.

## Information We Do Not Collect

Unlike many applications, Passwords 101 is designed with your privacy as the highest priority. Our app **does not collect, store, or transmit** any of the following:

- Personal identifiers (name, email address, phone number)
- Password data generated by the app
- Device information
- IP addresses
- Location data
- Usage statistics
- Browsing history
- Cookies or similar tracking technologies

## How Our App Works

Passwords 101 functions entirely on your local device. When you generate a password:

1. All password generation occurs locally on your device
2. No data is transmitted to our servers or any third parties
3. No record of generated passwords is maintained after you exit the relevant screen
4. No cloud synchronization of any data occurs

## Third-Party Services

Our app does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect or store any personal information or generated passwords, there is no risk of your data being compromised through our systems. This is because we don't have systems. It's just the app, locally on your device. Still, we recommend:

- Secure your device with appropriate measures (password/PIN/biometric protection)
- Be cautious about sharing your screen when generating passwords

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will post the updated Privacy Policy on our website and update the "Last Updated" date.

## Your Acceptance of These Terms

By using our app, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our app.
